# RockPaperScissorsGame

This is my first student project at SoftUni. 
The project goal is training my currently knowledge. 

1. Game description and it's rules:  
"RockPaperScissors" is a game, which plays by two players - you and the computer. The players choose one of three possible options: "rock",  "paper" or "scissors". The rules are as follows:

- "Rock" beats "Scissors ";
- "Paper" beats "Rock"; 
- "Scissors" beats "Paper";
- In case the choices are the same, the game outcome is "draw".

The winner is the player who chooses the winning option.

2. Program description:

input: 
The player enters one of the following options: 
- "r" or "rock"; 
- "p" or "papper"; 
- "s" or "scissors".

If the player enters invalid value, the program stops and prints that input is invalid.

The computer randomly generates one number from 0 to 3. 

I use the conditional statement "switch-case" to choose the computer's random move. 

After that I compare the choice of the player and the computer using conditional statement "if-else". 

output: 
- print your choice; 
- print computer choice;
- print who is winner.
